How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred way to submit a contribution is to fork the project on Github and
submit a pull request (no squashed commits, please) against the ``master``
branch that fixes a specific issue, please `file an issue`_ on Github beforehand
if one does not already exist.

`Travis`_ is used for continuous integration and the build for your pull request
must be successful before being merged.

Care has been taken to provide good test coverage, please ensure your
contribution maintains or improves this coverage.

Coding style
------------

Fugue mostly follows a relaxed PEP8 style, see `setup.cfg`_ for details. Instead
of laying out complex style rules that nobody likes to read, please do your best
to match the existing style employed throughout the code.
